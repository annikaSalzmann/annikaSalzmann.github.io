This is a writeup for the HTB Active Directory machine 'Forest'.

# Summary
## User Flag
To get access to the machine we'll use ASREP Roasting to exploit a bad Kerberos configuration that allows user accounts to not make use of pre-authentication.
This will allow us to get access to the hashed password and crack it offline. We can the connect with WinRM and obtain the user flag.
